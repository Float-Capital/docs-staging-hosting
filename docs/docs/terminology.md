# Terminology 
## Liquidity - Good/Bad
### Liquidity 

The availability of liquid assets to a market or company. Liquidity on Float refers to the amount of collateral deposited in the long and short sides of the markets.

### Good & Bad liquidity

Good liquidity refers to liquidity that has been added or removed from the protocol making the balance of long and short positions more balanced, while bad liquidity indicates the opposite.

### Liquidation  

Liquidation is simply your assets being converted to cash to cover your position. This is bad for users as it means they lose the funds they have deposited in the system. Your collateral will **never** be liquidated in Float! 

# Blockchain


### Smart contracts 

An agreement between two parties in the form of code that is run on the blockchain, and stored on a public ledger that cannot be changed. Transactions are processed by the blockchain and can be sent automatically without a third party. The Float protocol smart contracts define the set of rules of the system. The system is governed by code, where code is law.


### Blockchain wallet 

A digital wallet that allows users to store and manage cryptocurrencies. 

Examples of Blockchain wallets we recommend using: 

**MetaMask** - https://metamask.io/ 

**Torus**         - https://tor.us/ 

 ### Kovan testnet
 
 Kovan is an EVM compatible blockchain that is used for developing. This allows the team to develop and test the platform in a safe environment. Kovan has a faucet
allowing users to experiment with Kovan Ether (KETH) on the Kovan testnet. This is not real (Mainnet) ETH and it holds no market value but can be used to make transactions on the Kovan testnet.

### Polygon (formerly Matic) network 

An EVM compatible blockchain powered by a proof of stake algorithm.  Polygon is a growing blockchain with a large ecosystem of projects and is far more affordable on gas/transaction fees.

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

‚ÄúEVM‚Äù is a blockchain-based software platform allowing developers to create decentralized applications (Dapps) based on the architecture of the Ethereum blockchain. 

### Decentralization

A structure that allows for digital assets like cryptocurrencies to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.  Essentially the opposite of centralization, meaning no central or single party has control over the system.



### DEX (Decentralized Exchange) 

A peer-to-peer marketplace connecting cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. 

A great example of a ‚ÄúDEX‚Äù would be ‚ÄúQuickswap‚Äù. A decentralized finance protocol allowing the exchange of cryptocurrencies.

( Visit - https://quickswap.exchange )

### CEX (Centralized Exchanges) 

A type of cryptocurrency exchange operated by an entity or company on its own infrastructure. 

A great example of a ‚ÄúCEX‚Äù would be ‚ÄúCoinbase‚Äù.

( Visit - https://www.coinbase.com/
 )

**Note**:  A ‚ÄúDEX‚Äù is usually anonymous, as none of the user‚Äôs data is required for trading. Users have full possession of their private keys, and only need a wallet to trade on a decentralized exchange. Whilst ‚ÄúCEX‚Äù users usually have no control over their private keys. 

### Dominance 

The measure of a cryptocurrency‚Äôs market cap in relation to another cryptocurrency‚Äôs market cap (e.g Eth/Btc dominance) 


# Protocol 

### EthKillers

 The EthKillers is the first synthetic market offered by Float Capital and has alternative Blockchains to Ethereum, namely TRON, XRP, and EOS that tried to ‚Äúkill‚Äù Ethereum by attempting to reach a higher market value of their tokens and surpass Ethereum. 

( TRON - https://tron.network/ )

( XRP - https://ripple.com/xrp/ )

( EOS - https://eos.io/ )



### Float Exposure

 Because the value of long and short sides are not always longer equal, there is‚Äù floating exposure‚Äù. Users gain floating exposure to synthetic assets by joining either side of the market, one side of the market will always have 100% exposure while the other side of the market‚Äôs exposure will float between 0 - 100%. economic mechanisms exist to incentivize a balance in the market to remain within a certain band. An equally weighted market will have equal exposure on both sides.

### Governance Token

 Tokens that allow holders the opportunity to influence future protocols that will help shape the project. Holders are able to vote on new feature proposals and even change the governance system. Think of these tokens as being fairly similar to equity in a company. 

### Float Token 

This is the governance token of Float Capital. Float tokens are earned through staking any Float synthetic token in our token contract. 

### Synthetic asset token

A token that holds the same market value as an actual asset (e.g Gold). It allows users to get identical exposure to the risk and return benefits of the asset, without having to actually own the underlying asset.

### Going long 

A token with long exposure to the underlying market allows the user to  benefit from price appreciation. 

### Going short

  A token with short exposure to the Underlying market allows the user to benefit from price depreciation. 


### Index

A collection of stocks that fit a similar theme. These stocks are bundled together in what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúbasket‚Äù to mimic an economy, market, or sector, allowing investors to broadly track different securities. Examples of an index would be the S&P 500, the Dow, and the FTSE 100. 

### Minting 

Gaining exposure from minting a token in a long or short synthetic asset by depositing DAI as collateral

### Staking 

The act of locking tokens to receive rewards, e.g staking EthKillers long tokens to receive Float tokens. 

### Non-KYC  

‚ÄúKYC‚Äù means ‚Äúknow your customer,‚Äù and is the process of verifying a customer‚Äôs identity. A Non-KYC is a customer that is not required to give their personal details in order to access the markets.

### Over-collateralization 

 Used to define a situation where more collateral of an asset/assets value is used than what is needed to cover potential loss.

### What is an oracle 

  A decentralized network that provides real-time data to smart contracts on the blockchain of underlying assets, e.g the market value of gold in real-time. 


### Yield enhanced

 A platform feature that rewards users a yield or interest rate on their DAI as an extra benefit for using our system.


( Visit - https://aave.com/ )

### DAI  

A stablecoin cryptocurrency with the goal to keep its value as close to the United States Dollar. Float token uses DAI as the underlying collateral to mint a position
