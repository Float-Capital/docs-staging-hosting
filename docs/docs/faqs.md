### What do LongShort Tokens do?

Token holders gain anonymous decentralized exposure to the markets we offer. Holders benefit from price appreciation (holding long tokens) or depreciation (holding short tokens) of the underlying market, while also being compensated through the governance token (Float Tokens) when going against the herd by taking the side least in favor, and helping to balance the liquidity pools.

### Long Tokens VS Short Tokens VS Float Tokens.. The Differences.

Holders of Long Tokens benefit from increases in the price of the underlying market. Holders of Short Tokens benefit from decreases in the price of the underlying market. Holders of Float Tokens will benefit from the routine retirement of the Float Token done by the LongShort protocol using any fees left over after rewarding holders of the Long or Short token that's least in favor. The Float Token is the governance token and holders will therefore also have a say regarding changes to the protocol in the future.

### What is an Oracle? 

Simply put, it's a feed that communicates information from the real world to the blockchain. For the purposes of trading synthetic assets, the oracle would provide the price feed for the underlying. LongShort uses an oracle aggregator so that it is never relying on one single provider, and this increases the durability of the system.

 ### Why hold Float Governance Tokens?

The Float Token is the governance token and therefore holders will also have a say regarding changes to the protocol in the future.

### Will I Really be able to stay completely anonymous? 

Yes. KYC (Know Your Customer) is a due dilience process that traditional financial institutions are legally required to perform on you. It's completely normal for a traditional brokerage to know almost everything important about your financial life before they onboard you. With DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organisations) like Float Capital, everything is handled by the blockchain, so no one will ask what your salary is, the source and extent of your liquid net worth, or your level of trading experience.

### What is Binance Smart Chain?
It's another blockchain. LongShort is built on the Binance Smart Chain. 

### What are the Market Hours?  

Crypto markets are not limited to normal market hours. They are 24-hour and cannot be halted.  

### What is a Governance Token?

A governance token can be thought of a bit like equity in a company. Governance tokens give holders voting rights over proposed revisions to smart contracts, allowing them to have their voices heard on how a protocol operates. Some governance tokens (Float tokens included) give holders added benefits. Similar to stock buybacks, fees earned by the LongShort protocol that aren't paid out to holders in return for helping to balance the liquidity pools, will be used to buy back Float Tokens in the open market, thus decreasing the supply in circulation, and increasing their value.  

### Have the LongShort Smart Contracts been Audited?

Yes, you can find the audit reports [link: here].
