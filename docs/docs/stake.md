## Staking your float synthetic tokens 🏦

Your float synthetic tokens can be staked to earned float (governance) tokens.

Float earned is a function of the value, time and the balance of the liquidity in the market amongst other factors.

Simply follow instructions in the staking page to stake, or immediately choose to stake your synthetic tokens when minting them, in one simple transaction.

## Withdrawing your staked float synthetic tokens

Staked tokens can simply be withdrawn at any point by the user.
