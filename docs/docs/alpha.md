The Float Capital alpha release is an early release of our audited protocol on Polygon.

The launch is taking place on the 17th of Sept 2021 2pm UTC and the although the code has been audited we recommend use only for experienced DeFi investors.

<!-- Thoughts: Redeemable / Convertable -->

The alpha release will be launched with the alphaFloat token. The Float Governance token (FLT) will be launched with our main release.
The alphaFloat token will be convertible for value accrued to the system.

DAI is the stable coin required to mint a position. Polygon has provided a [faucet](https://matic.supply/) to receive a small amount of Matic token required for making transactions on the Polygon network.
