Float Capital uses [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/), a GraphQL API, for querying data from our smart contracts.

## [Mumbai Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/float-capital/testnet-dev)

## Polygon Subgraph (Coming soon)

We will be releasing examples soon on how you can make requests to our GraphQL server.
