## What is Float Capital 🤔

In fancy terms, Float Capital is a peer-to-peer, yield-enhanced, floating synthetic asset exposure mechanism.

Put simply, Float is the easiest and safest way for users to create synthetic assets. Users do not need to worry about over-collateralization, or suddenly getting liquidated.

Float is a new novel protocol, creating an efficient synthetic asset marketplace, governed entirely by code, allowing anyone around the world to get involved 🚀

## Float Capital Vision ✊

The vision of Float is to provide decentralized, trustless, and non-KYC gated exposure to various asset classes. Traditional financial markets are often complex, opaque and geographically separated, making it difficult for the average user to hold a diversified basket of assets. Further, traditional markets encompass layers of various services providers, all carrying subtle yet significant fees, tending to erode away a large amount of the end users investment returns.

Smart contracts allow us to seamlessly, trustly and most importantly, efficiently, coordinate a financial system where exposure to asset classes can be built in a peer-to-peer marketplace.

**Float is a financial paradigm where code is law.**

Float allows our global investor base to easily gain synthetic asset exposure, **without overcollateralization or leverage**, or any other financial mechanism designed to make you fail. Instead, Float uses a novel protocol (yes its not simply a fork of some existing protocol), allowing users to gain floating exposure to a synthetic asset, where economic mechanisms exist, incentivising exposure to the synthetic asset to remain within a certain band.
