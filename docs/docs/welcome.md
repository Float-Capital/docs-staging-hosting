## What is Float Capital 🤔

In fancy terms, Float Capital is a peer-to-peer, yield-enhanced, floating synthetic asset exposure mechanism.

Put simply, Float is the easiest and safest way for users to buy synthetic assets. Users do not need to worry about over-collateralization, or suddenly getting liquidated.

Float is a novel protocol, creating an efficient synthetic asset marketplace, governed entirely by code, allowing anyone around the world to get involved. 🚀

## Float Capital Vision ✊

The vision of Float is to provide decentralize and trustless exposure to various asset classes. Traditional financial markets are often complex, opaque and geographically separated, making it difficult for the average user to hold a diversified basket of assets. Further, traditional markets encompass layers of various services providers, all carrying subtle yet significant fees, tending to erode a large amount of the end-users investment returns.

Smart contracts allow for trustworthy and efficient coordination of a financial system where the user’s exposure to various assets can be built in a peer-to-peer marketplace.

**Float is a financial paradigm where code is law.**

Float allows our global investor base to easily gain synthetic asset exposure, **without over-collateralization, leverage**, or any other financial mechanism designed to make you fail. Instead, Float uses a novel protocol (yes, it's not simply a fork of some existing protocol), allowing users to gain floating exposure to a synthetic asset, where economic mechanisms exist, incentivising exposure to the synthetic asset to remain within a certain band.
