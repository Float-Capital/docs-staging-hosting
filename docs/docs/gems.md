## Collect ALL the Gems ðŸ’ 

Users can collect 250 GEMS for their first interaction with the Float Capital protocol every 24 hours. Keep your eyes peeled for more details on Gems coming soon, which may or may not involve [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf) in the future. ðŸ‘€

Gems can be collected through the following user actions:

- minting long and short positions on a market
- redeeming long or short synthetic tokens
- staking synthetic tokens
- unstaking synthetic tokens

Users can maintain their Gem collecting streak by interacting with the system every 24 hours! If 48 hours have passed since the last action the streak will be lost!
