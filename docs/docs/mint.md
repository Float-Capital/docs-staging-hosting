## Minting float synthetic tokens 💰

Minting involves minting a long or short synthetic token for a particular synthetic asset.

If you would like $1000 long exposure to a certain synthetic asset, you essentially call the 'mintLong' function on our smart contract which
mints you $1000 worth of long tokens, giving you long exposure to this synthetic asset.

Our Synthetic markets currently accept bUSD, allowing you mint your synthetic position.

## Buying float synthetic tokens on a DEX 🥞

You can also simply buy synthetic float tokens off a decentralized exchange such as pancake swap (coming soon) instead of minting exposure directly from the smart contracts.
