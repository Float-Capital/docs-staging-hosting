## Minting Float synthetic tokens 💰

Minting a token is how you can invest in a market. If you believe a market's price is going to go _up_ you can mint a long position in that market, inversely, if you believe a market's price is going to go _down_ then you would mint a short position in that market.

For example, if you would like $1 000 long exposure to a certain synthetic asset, you would visit the [markets](https://float.capital/) page and select to either _mint long_ or _mint short_. Minting a long position would mint you $1 000 worth of long tokens, giving you long exposure to this synthetic asset.

Our synthetic markets currently accept DAI, allowing you to mint your synthetic position.

## Buying Float synthetic tokens on a DEX

You can also simply buy synthetic Float tokens off a decentralized exchange such as [quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/) (liquidity pool coming soon) instead of minting exposure directly from the smart contracts.
