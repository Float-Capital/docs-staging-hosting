## Kovan Testnet 🔗

The protocol is deployed on the Kovan testnet. When interacting with the testnet version make sure your wallet is connected to the Kovan testnet.

To get Kovan Eth (KEth) and Kovan DAI you can visit the following faucets;

- [KEth](https://faucet.kovan.network/)
- [DAI](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet)

\*Pro tip: The Aave DAI faucet needs the market to be set to `Aave v2 K`, after switching you may need to revisit the faucet link.

Please note that the protocol is still under active development and some features might not function as expected.
