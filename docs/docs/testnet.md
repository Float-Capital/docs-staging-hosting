## Mumbai Testnet 🔗

The protocol is deployed on the Mumbai testnet. When interacting with the testnet version make sure your wallet is connected to the Mumbai testnet. The app will prompt you to connect to mumbai and add it to Metamask.

To get Mumbai Matic token and Mumbai DAI you can visit the following faucets;

- [Matic](https://faucet.matic.network/)
- [DAI](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet)

\*Note: The Aave DAI faucet needs the market to be set to `Aave Polygon M`, after switching you may need to revisit the faucet link. The aave faucet is down at the time of writing. Either mint the tokens directly from the aave contract or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/qesr2KZAhn) and someone on the team can send you some tokens for testing.

Please note that the protocol is still under active development and some features might not function as expected.
