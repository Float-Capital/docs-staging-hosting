## Mumbai Testnet 🔗

The protocol is deployed on the Mumbai testnet. When interacting with the testnet version make sure your wallet is connected to the Mumbai testnet. The app will prompt you to connect to mumbai and add it to Metamask.

To get Mumbai Matic token and Mumbai DAI you can visit the following faucets;

- [Matic](https://faucet.matic.network/)
- [DAI](https://float.capital/app/faucet)

Please note that the protocol is still under active development and some features might not function as expected. See our [alpha](/docs/alpha) for info on our early release on the Polygon network.
