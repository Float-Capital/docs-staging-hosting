If you’re reading this after that, you can trade <a href="https://float.capital/app/markets?selected=2&amp;actionOption=short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Whether you’re an Ohmie, one of the Float Capital degen traders, or someone new to both protocols, you’re in for a treat. Here’s why it matters, and how you can get diversified exposure to OHM.</p><p><strong>*Update: open a position in our OHM v2 market <a href="https://bit.ly/3fjTcdL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong></p><header><h1 class="h1Heading_27L5">Trade OHM with 2x leverage with Polygon</h1></header><p>Now users can get exposure to OHM on Polygon, which offers lightning-fast speeds and lower transaction costs. For example, trading with Float Capital generally requires paying ~0.015 MATIC per transaction, or roughly $0.02.</p><p>The Float Capital OHM market will launch with a 2x leverage, meaning your exposure to price movement will be doubled.</p><p>For example, say you have a long position in a perfectly balanced market with 100% exposure in Float, and the price goes up by 10%. That will result in a 20% gain on your position.</p><p>Now say you’re staking $100 of OHM, and you want to open a short position to completely remove your exposure to price movements. In a 1x leveraged market, you would need to put down a full $100. In a 2x leveraged market, with 100% exposure you can fully hedge your position with just $50, or half the position you want to hedge.</p><p>Way more on this below.</p><p>If you’re new to Polygon, you can bridge your tokens across <a href="https://wallet.polygon.technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><header><h1 class="h1Heading_27L5">Advanced Trading for OHMIES</h1></header><p>Here’s the really cool part:</p><p>The Float Capital OHM market is enabling a whole new trading strategy for OHM stakers.</p><p>Previously, Ohmies have only had the option of staking, bonding, or, <em>much worse</em>, selling. But selling isn’t very (3,3) of you.</p><p>The Float Capital OHM market opens up the possibility of a new strategy that doesn’t undermine the game theory inherent to the Olympus community: going delta neutral.</p><p>This means, in addition to your OHM stake, you can hold a short position on OHM to reduce your exposure to market volatility.</p><p>This will allow users to keep earning rewards for staking OHM, hedge against downward movements in the market, and earn FLT tokens from Float’s own staking incentives.</p><p>Currently FLT is in its alpha phase, so users will earn alphaFLT when staking in Float. When FLT launches around the end of 2021, alphaFLT will be taken off the market and current holders of the token will be rewarded.</p><header><h1 class="h1Heading_27L5">Calculating a delta neutral position</h1></header><p>A delta neutral strategy is equivalent to having zero exposure to the price of the underlying asset, in this case the OHM token. This means having 100% exposure to the price going up (long) and having 100% exposure to the price going down (short), simultaneously.</p><p>This allows APY returns without being exposed to the price movements of the OHM token. It’s a risk averse strategy for farming rewards.</p><p>Because the exposure in our markets ‘floats’ based on the balance of capital in each market, hedging your OHM position isn’t as simple as putting in 100% of your OHM position to get 100% hedging.</p><p>To understand this, head over to the market and check the exposure.</p><img src="/blog-assets/ohm/ohm-exposure.png" alt="Olympus DAO OHM exposure float capital" width="100%"><p>To explain exposure, we’ll use an example:</p><p>Let’s say Nachos has $1,000 of OHM tokens staked. This equates to 100% exposure to $1,000 of value. In order to get a delta neutral position he will need to get $1,000 value of short exposure.</p><p>Nachos would head over to Float Capital and check the exposure on the short side of the OHM market.</p><p>If that exposure is 100%, then in a 2x leveraged market, he will be able to fully hedge his position with only a $500 short position.</p><p>If the exposure is lower, say that it’s 50%, then since it’s a 2x leverage market, Nachos would go $1,000 short to get $1,000 short value exposure.</p><p>To make it easier to process, we’ve built a calculator for you in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17YUOcFmY1M9rAaJiYzMNzSugI0TGqKcd03RwUyWNAEc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google sheet</a>. Just make a copy and punch in your OHM stake.</p><p>If you’re old school and have a calculator handy, here’s the math:</p><p>Firstly we start with</p><ul><li>The dollar value of your OHM position ($OhmStake)</li><li>The short exposure on the OHM 2x Leverage market on Float Capital (%ShortExposure)</li></ul><p>And we calculate for:</p><ul><li>Dollar amount to go short in OHM market on Float Capital ($FloatPosition)</li></ul><p>That works out to:</p><p>$FloatPosition = $OhmStake / (2 * %ShortExposure)</p><p>You can see the math in more detail <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/skpybmnqsrdy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Once you’ve got your calculation ready, make sure that you have enough DAI in your wallet to cover that position in Float.</p><p>When you’ve done that, head across and stake your short <a href="https://float.capital/app/markets?selected=2&amp;actionOption=short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You’ll get the hedge you want with all the benefits of your OHM stake, and the added benefits from the Float protocol rewards system.</p><p>Just remember – in Float Capital, your leveraged exposure floats. This means that the position needed to hedge may change as the price of OHM changes and the market shifts.</p><p>To keep your hedge you will need to check in regularly and recalculate.</p><header><h1 class="h1Heading_27L5">Secure pricing data from Chainlink</h1></header><p>The Float Capital OHM asset will be powered by market data supplied by a <a href="https://chain.link/solutions/defi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chainlink Price Feed</a> on the Polygon network.

This has helped us unlock insights required for fine-tuning the parameters used in the protocol mechanisms.</p><p>A useful by-product of this is being able to share the results and insights with the community and future FLT token holders, who will eventually <strong>champion</strong> the governance of Float Capital DAO.</p><p>As one can reasonably expect, the results of the modelling process depend largely on the data as well as the assumptions made - let&#x27;s talk briefly about them before interpreting the results.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="data"></a><strong>Data</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#data" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We chose the Flipp3ning as the on-chain asset for modelling, the first market on Float Capital in the Alpha launch.
This is a 3x leveraged version of the Flippening, which is calculated as market capitalization of ETH over market capitalization of BTC.</p><p>The market movements of ETH and BTC can tend to be quite correlated at times as most outside speculation of crypto does not differentiate between coins, hence the reason for the 3x leverage to increase the volatility of the on-chain asset.</p><p>The modelling process runs over 30 days’ worth of data, recorded at an hourly interval; the actual heartbeat (frequency) of price feed in the Alpha and mainnet launch will actually be approximately 5 minutes, so we observed greater volatility in this data than we would observe on the protocol.</p><img src="/blog-assets/backtesting-flipp3ning/flipp3ning-historical.png" alt="flipp3ning-backetesting" width="100%"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="protocol-mechanisms"></a><strong>Protocol mechanisms</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#protocol-mechanisms" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Float Capital is a peer-to-peer magic internet asset marketplace where each market provides users with the option to take both long and short positions (for more information on Float Capital, click <a href="https://docs.float.capital/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Based on the total liquidity on each side (long and short), the one with the less liquidity (the undercapitalized side) will have 100% exposure to price movements and the one with more liquidity (the overcapitalized side) will have exposure equal to the ratio of the undercapitalized side to overcapitalized side (for example, if long has $100 and short has $90, short side will have 100% exposure and long side will have 90/100 = 90% exposure). This floating exposure mechanism ensures that the gains/losses due to price movements are always 100% collateralized in the protocol.</p><p>Then you might ask, for a given on-chain asset with a price trajectory, will one side not be greater than the other?</p><p>Yes, and hence enter the balancing incentives.</p><p>In Float Capital, users who mint positions in the undercapitalized side earn a portion of the yield that is generated by putting the total liquidity locked in the market into AAVE. Users with positions in the overcapitalized side do not receive any portion of the yield.
The balance of the yield is sent to the Treasury DAO and will provide price support for FLT tokens that are in circulation (for the Alpha launch, alphaFLT tokens will be issued instead of FLT tokens).
This incentivizes the users to balance the markets and hence bring the exposure of the overcapitalized side closer to 100%. This additional yield is calculated using a curve (click <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXsW4cHtxpJ5BFwRcMSUw7s5G11Qkte13NTEfPLTKEx4x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for formula and <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pnl43tfv5b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for graph).
There are further incentives in the form of higher FLT token issuance to users who stake on-chain tokens of the undercapitalized side, but we will cover the fine details of FLT token in another article.
In short, the FLT token is a rewards token to incentivise liquidity provision with mechanisms for profit share and price support while also acting as a governance token for the protocol.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="other-assumptions"></a><strong>Other assumptions</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#other-assumptions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Given the protocol mechanisms above and the price feeds, we project 2 types of liquidity injections into the system.
One is for the initial liquidity that float capital will inject into the system to ensure that the exposure for the users stays as close to 100% for the immediate future (until whales come to play) and the other for the subsequent liquidity that users will inject based on the market movements.</p><p>The user liquidity has been further divided into 2 types - <em>performance-based</em> and <em>incentive-based</em>.
<em>Performance-based</em> users will assess the recent performance of the on-chain asset in determining whether to enter long or short positions, whereas <em>incentive-based</em> users will assess the excess yield to determine whether to enter long or short positions.

This is in a similar vein to how we can release the Float Alpha without locking into a final smart contract design and hence allowing us to avoid large amounts of legacy so we can react quicker in future.</p><p>What will alphaFLT give you? At a very minimum, alphaFLT will entitle you to a proportional share of the Float Alpha treasury that will be accruing value throughout the Alpha. There are other possibilities which are still being modeled by the team. alphaFLT will initially be non-transferable while liquidity grows.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="alphaflt-issuance"></a><strong>alphaFLT issuance</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#alphaflt-issuance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>alphaFLT will be issued throughout the Float Capital Alpha phase. Currently 75% of all alphaFLT issued is going to users who stake magic internet assets and provide liquidity. 25% of alphaFLT issuance is accruing to a separate smart contract earmarked for the team, investors, advisors and founders, along with a few other strategic uses.</p><p>Importantly, alphaFLT is only ever issued based on the dollar value of your magic internet asset that you have staked, and the length of time which you have staked. Therefore, these tokens are only gradually generated over time as valuable actions occur in the platform.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="fees"></a><strong>Fees</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#fees" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There are no fees associated with minting, staking or redeeming magic internet assets. The only fees being levied in the Alpha are on unstaking your magic internet assets. This is currently set at 50 basis points or 0.5%. These fees accrue to the DAO treasury contract governed by Float Capital users.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="where-to-find-out-more"></a><strong>Where to find out more</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#where-to-find-out-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As much as we&#x27;ve gone through already, this is only the tip of the iceberg. There are so many interesting things happening under the hood, it&#x27;s an oasis for economists, computer scientists, mathematicians, financial engineers and statistical scientists.</p><p>The best way to understand the nuts and bolts is to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/dqDwgrVYcU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord</a> server and simply send a message.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="disclosures"></a><strong>DISCLOSURES</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#disclosures" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="only-deposit-money-you-can-afford-to-lose"></a><strong>Only deposit money you can afford to lose</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#only-deposit-money-you-can-afford-to-lose" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>This is a highly innovative and complex protocol that does not exist on any other chains or in any other galaxies. There is an <a href="https://docs.float.capital/blog/apeing-in-responsibly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">element of risk</a> involved, and it&#x27;s important you do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="team-holdings-and-positions-in-the-alpha"></a><strong>Team holdings and positions in the Alpha</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#team-holdings-and-positions-in-the-alpha" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>It&#x27;s important we are transparent. Given we will initially be playing a large role in deciding what becomes of alphaFLT tokens and how it connects with FLT tokens in the future, we want to remain impartial and choose only what is best for the protocol and not for personal gains.</p><p>Given this insight, it&#x27;s important we disclose the following internal trading restrictions: Float team members in their personal capacity should not be staking more than $2,000 of their personal capital initially. This target might change and we reserve the right to increase it. Any alphaFLT that is earned on staked positions over $2,000 will be redistributed in some form to benefit the protocol at large.</p><p>Additionally we are also running a team trading competition where every team member has been given $100 to trade. You will notice the protocol was actually deployed and went live on Monday. To ensure a smooth launch and have rigorous testing, we have been using these $100 amounts to test the protocol. Note that we have limited test staking to $1 of capital, over short periods, to ensure no one is earning alphaFLT unfairly ahead of the release.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learn-more"></a><strong>Learn more</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#learn-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you want to learn even more about Float, you can visit the <a href="https://docs.float.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs section</a> of our website.</p><p>If you want breaking news, memes and announcements, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/float_capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.</p><p>If you want to join the community, meet the team and get involved in the future of Float, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/StYzV8MP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/apeing-in-responsibly">Apeing in Responsibly: Managing risk in the Float Alpha</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-09-16T00:00:00.000Z">September 16, 2021</time> · 7 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><div class="avatar__intro"></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><img src="/blog-assets/apeing/apeing-in-responsibly.png" alt="apeing in responsibly" width="100%"><em>“Apeing In Responsibly (AIR)” — the practice of depositing a large amount of liquidity in a protocol while understanding the risks.

Please consider these.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="composability-risk"></a>Composability risk<a class="hash-link" href="#composability-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The Float Alpha deposits all underlying user funds into <a href="https://aave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aave</a>, a borrowing and lending protocol. While Aave has received many audits and been live in production without incident for a fair amount of time, if Aave were to be exploited, this may have implications for Float. Research Aave, understand the risks of using Aave, and note that the inherent risks of using Aave interact with the risks of using Float.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="centralization-risk"></a>Centralization risk<a class="hash-link" href="#centralization-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The Float smart contracts are upgradeable. Having upgradeable smart contracts means that the code can change. If we were malicious, rug pulling devs, we could upgrade the contracts and drain funds. Thankfully, our team is publicly known and committed to the growth of DeFi over the long term. Our reputation is worth far more than a rug.</p><p>Generally timelocks and multisigs are the two main methods to safeguard against this while maintaining upgradeability, while allowing for swift iteration. While we will utilize these in our main launch, in our Alpha with lower stakes we are not using timelocks or multisigs. This will change as the protocol scales.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="oracle-risk"></a>Oracle risk<a class="hash-link" href="#oracle-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Historically, oracles have been a significant vector of attacks. Please read <a href="https://samczsun.com/so-you-want-to-use-a-price-oracle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this piece</a> if you want to learn more about the risks of using oracles. Our smart contracts heavily rely on oracles, and hence the risks associated with this tech apply to Float as well. To mitigate this risk, Float Capital uses Chainlink as an oracle service provider for our smart contracts. Chainlink is widely recognised as having safe and secure tech, but if exploits are found with their contracts, Float could be exposed as well.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stablecoin-risk"></a>Stablecoin risk<a class="hash-link" href="#stablecoin-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The Float Alpha will accept DAI as the token to mint assets. DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin that has proven itself a resilient token in the past, surviving the crypto winter of 2018, but please understand the risks associated with this technology.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="financial-risk"></a>Financial risk<a class="hash-link" href="#financial-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Float allows you to purchase magic internet assets which will track the value of an underlying asset and therefore increase or decrease in value over time. You may purchase magic internet assets that significantly decrease in value over time. This is especially true in the crypto space where we see many volatile markets.</p><p>Additionally, some magic internet assets may have leverage. This will be clearly stated alongside each asset. This essentially magnifies your gains or losses, and hence magnifies your risk. Make sure you understand what leverage is and how it can get you rekt.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="liquidation-risk"></a>Liquidation risk<a class="hash-link" href="#liquidation-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>None. Unlike older onchain asset platforms, Float Capital has no risk of liquidation for users.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ape-risk"></a>Ape risk<a class="hash-link" href="#ape-risk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The risk of enjoying the Float platform so much that you over commit capital to the protocol.
