But, there is one major risk to consider â€“ price exposure. .</p><p>AXS staking rewards are paid in more AXS. Normally more AXS is a good thing, but if the price drops while youâ€™re staking, then your stake and all the rewards earned will lose value.</p><p>Thereâ€™s an easy way of reducing this risk though â€“Â going delta neutral.</p><p>Delta neutral trading strategies remove the risk of market exposure. They make sure that every point of long exposure in a trading strategy is counterbalanced by equivalent short exposure.</p><p>That means that if the price to which the positions are exposed goes up, the long position increases in value and the short decreases proportionally. When the price goes down, the short increases in value, and the long decreases proportionally.</p><p>By going delta neutral in Float Capitalâ€™s <a href="http://float.capital/app/markets?marketIndex=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AXS market</a>, youâ€™re free to mine AXS rewards AND alphaFLT rewards without worrying about unfavourable price action.</p><p>Hereâ€™s how you can get started with a delta neutral AXS strategy:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="staking-axs"></a>Staking AXS<a class="hash-link" href="#staking-axs" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><em>Skip this if youâ€™re an Axie expert and have a pile of AXS staked already.</em></p><p>To stake AXS you need a Ronin wallet.</p><p>You can create one easily. Download the app <a href="https://roninwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Make sure to back up your private key and password somewhere secure. Sky Mavis recommends adding a hardware wallet as an additional layer of security.</p><p>Once your wallet is ready, you need AXS.</p><p>There are a few ways to get AXS. The easiest way is to play Axie Infinity. AXS is rewarded within the game, alongside Smooth Love Potion. You can then swap SLP for AXS by using Roninâ€™s native <a href="https://katana.roninchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katana Dex</a>. Alternatively you can simply bridge USDC or wETH and swap it for AXS.</p><p>If you already have AXS, or other assets you want to bridge to Ronin to swap for AXS, use the<a href="https://bridge.roninchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ronin bridge</a>.</p><p>You can also buy AXS directly on Ronin from <a href="https://ramp.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramp</a>.</p><p>Once you have your AXS, head over to the <a href="https://stake.axieinfinity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staking dashboard</a> and check out that juicy APY.</p><img src="/blog-assets/axs/axs-apy.png" alt="float axis infinity" width="100%"><p>Simply connect your Ronin wallet, select stake AXS, and confirm the transaction.

These will allow users to trade, hedge, and mine rewards without leaving Avalanche.</p><p>No hints yet, but youâ€™ll be able to open leveraged shorts on some of these assets for the very first time, and create tons of new trading and hedging opportunities.</p><p>We may even experiment with different payment tokens. Currently all our markets accept DAI, but weâ€™re going to use Avalanche to test out some new payment tokens. Say no more for now, but we arenâ€™t talking about stablecoins.</p><p>All of our Avalanche markets will have a 30 minute heartbeat â€“ meaning that they receive price updates and process trades at least every 30 minutes. If the price deviation hits a certain threshold, this process will occur sooner.</p><p>As always our Avalanche markets will be powered by Chainlink price feeds.

The phenomena arises when a sequence of leveraged movements compound to a value that is different than the leverage multiple of non-leveraged movements, which disproves the perception that investing in leveraged assets will give you exactly leveraged returns.</p><p>At the core is the fact that the relationship between compounding of returns and compounding of linear multiples of those returns, is not linear.</p><p>Volatility decay over a period for a leveraged asset can be formalised as: </p><p><code>Volatility Decay = leverage * unleveraged returns - leveraged returns</code></p><p>For example, if no-leverage movements are 5% then -10% respectively, the net return is -5.5% (1.05 * 0.90 = 0.945).</p><p>For a 2x leveraged asset, the movements then are 10% and -20%, with net return being -12%.
So volatility decay after 2 movements is 2*(-5.5%) - (-12%) = 1%, meaning someone holding a long 2x leveraged asset has underperformed the leverage multiple of a no-leverage asset by 1%.</p><p>Hence volatility decay implies the leverage, say 2x, can result in returns different to a 2x multiple of non-leveraged returns.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-does-it-look-like-on-float-capital"></a>What does it look like on Float Capital?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-it-look-like-on-float-capital" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The absolute amount of volatility decay depends on certain factors:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exposure-to-the-price-movements"></a>Exposure to the price movements<a class="hash-link" href="#exposure-to-the-price-movements" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The greater the exposure to leveraged movements, the greater the [absolute] volatility decay.
Our floating exposure mechanism means that the overbalanced side of a market will have a smaller degree of volatility decay experienced, as exposure will be less than 100%.</p><p>For the 2-OHM market, the exposure on the short side has been gradually decreasing, and therefore the size of absolute volatility decay has been decreasing as well â€“ graph below.</p><img src="/blog-assets/volatility-decay-intro/exposure-2-ohm.png" alt="Exposure 2-OHM" width="100%"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="leverage-employed"></a>Leverage employed<a class="hash-link" href="#leverage-employed" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Currently our first 2 markets (Flipp3ning and 3TH) have 3x leverage, whereas our third market has 2x leverage on OHM. When it comes to leverage, there is a trade-off between capital efficiency and volatility decay.</p><p>For a user wanting to gain vanilla $1000 long exposure to OHM, it means that user has to only mint $500 on long 2-OHM (assuming exposure of 100%) to gain this exposure, allowing users to allocate their capital more efficiently.</p><p>However, the greater the leverage the greater the potential for volatility decay, and one way to find the correct balance is to observe the historical volatility decay in our markets and see whether they are at acceptable levels.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="absolute-difference-in-price-between-entry-and-exit"></a>Absolute difference in price between entry and exit<a class="hash-link" href="#absolute-difference-in-price-between-entry-and-exit" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The greater the difference in underlying price of the asset â€’ from the time a user enters the market to the time that they exit â€’ the greater the [absolute] volatility decay. For example, if a user enters a market when the price of the underlying asset is $100 and then exits when the price is $200, they would experience greater volatility decay than if they exited when the price was $150. The same goes for negative price movements. Note that the volatility decay is not necessarily 0 if the user exited at the same price that they entered.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="magnitude-of-underlying-price-movements"></a>Magnitude of underlying price movements<a class="hash-link" href="#magnitude-of-underlying-price-movements" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Float Capital updates userâ€™s positions when the oracle price feed of the underlying asset gives a new price. The higher the change in the underlying price, the higher the volatility decay will be for any users with active positions at the time of price update. This effect is compounded when there are multiple price updates of high magnitude in the same direction, and is dampened when there are multiple price updates of high magnitude in opposite directions. For example, if there are 2 positive price movements (not necessarily consecutive) of high magnitude then the volatility decay is higher than if there was 1 positive and 1 negative of the same magnitude. </p><p>Note that the only time a userâ€™s volatility decay is affected by large single price movements is if they hold a position in the market at the time of the price movement i.e. historical price movements do not affect new investments.</p><p>So how high is high? This is something that will be explored in detail in the next blog. But very basically: the relationship between the magnitude of a single price movement and the resulting volatility decay is linear (whose factor/gradient is dependent on the market leverage less 1), and is offset by the volatility decay before the price offset. For [a rough] example, if the current volatility decay for a user in a 2x leveraged market is 01% and the magnitude of the next price update is 10% then the resulting volatility decay is also 10% ; and in a 3x leveraged market it would be 20%). Note that this is a rough example and may not be entirely accurate.</p><p>The higher the inherent volatility of the asset, greater the potential volatility decay.</p><p>To reduce the volatility of the underlying asset as much as possible, Float uses a deviation threshold of 0.5% and a maximum heartbeat of 5 minutes (actually heartbeat for 3TH market is 27 seconds), asset by our oracle provider, Chainlink.</p><p>This means that the price feed will at least update every heartbeat, but also update sooner if the price changes by more than 0.5% from the previous price.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="volatility-decay-for-short-side-of-2-ohm-market"></a>Volatility Decay for short side of 2-OHM market<a class="hash-link" href="#volatility-decay-for-short-side-of-2-ohm-market" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><img src="/blog-assets/volatility-decay-intro/vol-decay-short-2-ohm.png" alt="Vol Decay Short 2-OHM" width="100%"><p>This graph shows the cumulative returns of 2-OHM (in blue) and OHM (in red) for the short side, as well as the volatility decay so far (in green) assuming that someone had entered the market from 2 Nov 2021 when market was created.</p><p>We see that volatility decay dropped to -2% in around 5 December 2021, which means that someone holding short 2-OHM would have outperformed someone holding twice the amount in vanilla OHM by 2%.</p><p>We have observed volatility decay from the short side above â€“ what does this look like on the long side? A similar calculation can be done for volatility decay on the long side, which does not necessarily produce an equal and opposite value to the short volatility decay. </p><p>It is also important to note that because Float Capital is a peer-to-peer market, volatility decay is not lost forever, meaning volatility decay for one side is a gain for the other side on Float Capital, unlike in TradFi where the volatility decay cannot be captured and awarded to someone else.</p><p>For example, if the long side has experienced a 0.9% volatility decay over a 7-day period, then that 0.9% is retained by the short side.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="in-summary"></a>In Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#in-summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Volatility decay is something inevitable when it comes to leveraged assets, and the best is to put measures in place to limit its size.</p><p>In the article, we explored the mechanisms in place on Float Capital (such as floating exposure and our current practice with Chainlink) which reduce the size of volatility decay as much as possible for users.</p><p>One view that could be taken toward volatility decay is that it is the cost of using a capital efficient asset, which is achieved by employing leverage.</p><p>The amount of liquidity that did not shift as a result of volatility decay, will remain on the opposite side of the market (i.e. opposite side benefits from volatility decay on one side).</p><p>More technical deep dive coming soon for the wrinkle-brained Floatonians.</p><p>Happy leveraged trading!</p><p>If you want to learn more about Float Capital,<a href="https://docs.float.capital/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> check out our docs</a>,<a href="https://docs.float.capital/assets/files/FLOAT_CAPITAL_whitepaper-47161fff19d61864625c9dd681117f29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> read our whitepaper</a>, or<a href="https://discord.gg/yssvcFYbV9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> join our Discord</a>.</p><p>This piece was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/WooSung40265546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woo Sung Dong</a> and Stent (Anon).</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/shipping-a-funding-rate">Weâ€™re shipping a funding rate. Hereâ€™s why and how.</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-28T00:00:00.000Z">November 28, 2021</time> Â· 5 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><div class="avatar__intro"></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><img src="/blog-assets/funding-rates/container-ship.jpg" alt="Floating SHIP" width="100%"><p>Float Capital has experienced explosive success with our OHM-USD market and our partnership with Olympus DAO. It has attracted so much capital that for a week during the last month we were the fastest growing derivatives protocol in all of DeFi.</p><p>However the success of the OHM market has raised a new challenge â€“ the current mechanisms arenâ€™t strong enough to incentivize better market balance between long and short positions with an asset that has a &gt;7000% rebase APY.</p><p>Because of this the majority of the OHM market positions are short. As a result the short positions are overbalanced and receive minimal short exposure since there is not enough long liquidity to take the other side of the trade. This makes Float a less efficient tool for hedging positions.</p><p>To correct this we will be introducing a funding rate mechanism to the protocol.</p><p>Float is still in the alpha stage and constantly refining the protocol to handle any type of market and any kind of asset. Our thesis remains, build, ship, iterate. The OHM market has been an incredible experiment and has shown us our path forward so that when the protocol moves out of alpha we will be able to create any kind of Magic Internet Asset.</p><p><strong>Funding rate</strong></p><p>When launching the protocol we initially thought that the leveraged yield incentive (all liquidity earning yield channelled to the underbalanced side) + asymmetric alphaFLT accrual would be enough to cater for this imbalance. However (alphaFLT aside), users going long OHM in Float only receive a 60% leveraged yield from aave for being long in contrast to getting &gt;7000% (rebase rewards) for it by staking their OHM on mainnet.</p><p><em>Our solution</em> - a funding rate! A funding rate is not a concept that we invented. Many perpetuals use funding rates to bring their assets to closely track their underlying. It was ambitious that we thought we could build a protocol that didnâ€™t need this primitive, and not all markets need it. However, the OHM market, Iâ€™m sure you will agree, NEEDS a funding rate!</p><p><em>What is a funding rate?</em> A funding rate is payment made from the overbalanced side to the underbalanced side, to incentivize more balance in the market. More specifically for Float Capital there will be a constant trickle of liquidity from the overbalanced side to the underbalanced side of the market. As the markets become more imbalanced, the funding rate increases. For reference <a href="https://ftxpremiums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> are the funding rates for FTX.</p><p><strong>Float funding rate implementation</strong></p><p><em>How will this mechanism work?</em> We set a maximum funding rate for the overbalanced side that would only be achieved if the market were completely imbalanced (i.e. there was no liquidity on the underbalanced side). We then scale the funding rate linearly based on the imbalance. This simple formula can be seen <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/glkmxykdcx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. We have additional parameters that we can introduce later to adjust the shape of this curve, but we believe that the linear curve will be sufficient to create a massive impact while still remaining conservative. We are not expecting the funding rate alone to be enough to rebalance the market alone, rather it will be the second order effect of traders coming into the market to accept the high yields that rebalances the market.</p><p><em>What is a good initial funding rate setting for this market?</em> It is hard to know what kind of risk tolerance the market will have to going-in on the long side of OHM.</p><p>Given our current market imbalance, an additional APY of 2,000-3,500% could be sufficient. 3,500% with 2x leverage would be equivalent to the maximum longing OHM and staking can earn: ~7,000%. 2,000% is due to the increased capital efficiency of using Float Capital, the market fragmentation of being on a different blockchain and the easy access enabled by the low gas fees of polygon.</p><p>Being sensibly conservative, the initial proposal for implementation of this funding rate is a maximum of 300% for the OHM market, which at the current exposure of ~10% would mean the short side pays an annualized funding rate of 270%, or an hourly rate 0.03%.</p><p>This would give long OHM an APY of 2,400%.</p><p>If that has an underwhelming effect on the market we will take steps to increase it by a reasonable amount the next week, and again until it has the desired effect.</p><p>If the market rebalances to 50% exposure this would reduce to a funding rate of 150% on the short side and an APY boost on the long side of 300%</p><p>A funding rate of 270%, that we expect to reduce over time, is still comfortably below some of the larger funding rates that appear on FTX (which frequently go to 800% at times).</p><img src="/blog-assets/funding-rates/ftx-funding-rates.png" alt="FTX funding rates" width="100%"><p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/Float-Capital/contracts/commit/11a085fa9f5e433e3d57252cc845d393cd3906b0#r60963608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our code</a>, which is currently in for a 3rd party audit.
