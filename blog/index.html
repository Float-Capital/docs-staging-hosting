target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JOE magic internet asset</a> in Float Capital.</p><p>Now users can mint a position and get long and short exposure to JOE at 2x leverage.</p><p>Or, JOE stakers can come across and go delta neutral. That means opening a short position equivalent to the long exposure of their stake.</p><p>By shorting your own stake, you can reduce your price exposure, sit back and mine JOE staking APY, with way less risk. Think of it as JOE farming, with protection from price drops.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-biggest-dex-on-avalanche"></a>The biggest DEX on Avalanche<a class="hash-link" href="#the-biggest-dex-on-avalanche" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trader Joe</a> is one of the core protocols in the Avalanche ecosystem, facilitating swaps, pools and farms, and most recently lending, through their recent Banker Joe launch.</p><p>The DEX is powered by the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/joe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JOE governance token</a>.</p><p>Staked JOE earns a neat ~40% APY in the protocol, which can be tapped for another ~25% APY by lending the XJOE you get through Banker Joe.</p><p>It’s an incredible strat, if the user isn’t worried about price exposure.</p><p>But with a delta neutral strat, a degen staker can reduce that risk.</p><p>Here’s how.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="going-delta-neutral"></a>Going delta neutral<a class="hash-link" href="#going-delta-neutral" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Going delta neutral is a super degen strategy that completely, or partially, removes exposure price movements.</p><p>In most cases, when prices only go up, price movements are great.</p><p>But in bearish markets, or when big amounts of wealth are involved, delta neutral strats can allow apes to take an element of risk out of their portfolios.</p><p>This can be super useful when staking an asset, like JOE, that has tasty rewards for users who can resist unstaking and selling.</p><p>So what would a delta neutral JOE position look like?</p><p>First, get some JOE. If you’re new to Avalanche, swap some AVAX for it on <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trader Joe</a>.</p><p>Then, head over to the <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/stake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staking dashboard</a>, and check out that sweet, sweet APR.</p><img src="/blog-assets/joe/staking-apr-joe.png" alt="float joe" width="100%"><p>Connect your wallet and select the amount of JOE to stake. Click stake. You’ll need to approve the app, then confirm the transaction.</p><p>By staking JOE you’ll swap your tokens for XJOE. The ratio of XJOE to JOE is constantly appreciating, so later you’ll be able to swap your XJOE into more JOE than you originally staked.</p><p>For an added layer of degeneracy, you can take your XJOE and lend it out in <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/lending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banker Joe</a>.</p><p>Now comes the delta neutral part. Head across to <a href="https://avalanche.float.capital/app/markets?marketIndex=2&amp;actionOption=short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Float Capital’s JOE market</a>.</p><p>You’ll need to open a short position equivalent to the value of your staked JOE. Make sure you have some DAI to mint a position.</p><p>There are two variables to take into account when calculating your position.</p><p>The first is the market’s leverage: in this case 2x.</p><p>The second is the market’s exposure level. This is shown on the market stats at the bottom of the page, on the lower right hand side.</p><p>If the short side has 100% exposure, then, because of the 2x leverage, your short will be half the dollar value of your staked JOE. If it’s less than 100%, then we need to do some math.</p><p>Remember, the exposure can change based on the balance of capital in the market, so you will need to check this and rebalance periodically.</p><p>To calculate your short you’ll need a few variables:</p><p>Your JOE stake = joeStake
The short exposure = shortExposure
The size of your short position = short</p><p>Putting that together we get:</p><p>short = joeStake / (2 * shortExposure)</p><p>Or, you can just make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fk7McdHZZNYz4xTJrWajANTUlfzhJoXXGB_AcVIFK20/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheet</a> and punch in your figures.</p><p>Remember to check the exposure level regularly, to make sure that your stake is adequately covered.

Normally more AXS is a good thing, but if the price drops while you’re staking, then your stake and all the rewards earned will lose value.</p><p>There’s an easy way of reducing this risk though – going delta neutral.</p><p>Delta neutral trading strategies remove the risk of market exposure. They make sure that every point of long exposure in a trading strategy is counterbalanced by equivalent short exposure.</p><p>That means that if the price to which the positions are exposed goes up, the long position increases in value and the short decreases proportionally.

Sky Mavis recommends adding a hardware wallet as an additional layer of security.</p><p>Once your wallet is ready, you need AXS.</p><p>There are a few ways to get AXS. The easiest way is to play Axie Infinity. AXS is rewarded within the game, alongside Smooth Love Potion. You can then swap SLP for AXS by using Ronin’s native <a href="https://katana.roninchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katana Dex</a>.

The phenomena arises when a sequence of leveraged movements compound to a value that is different than the leverage multiple of non-leveraged movements, which disproves the perception that investing in leveraged assets will give you exactly leveraged returns.</p><p>At the core is the fact that the relationship between compounding of returns and compounding of linear multiples of those returns, is not linear.</p><p>Volatility decay over a period for a leveraged asset can be formalised as: </p><p><code>Volatility Decay = leverage * unleveraged returns - leveraged returns</code></p><p>For example, if no-leverage movements are 5% then -10% respectively, the net return is -5.5% (1.05 * 0.90 = 0.945).</p><p>For a 2x leveraged asset, the movements then are 10% and -20%, with net return being -12%.
So volatility decay after 2 movements is 2*(-5.5%) - (-12%) = 1%, meaning someone holding a long 2x leveraged asset has underperformed the leverage multiple of a no-leverage asset by 1%.</p><p>Hence volatility decay implies the leverage, say 2x, can result in returns different to a 2x multiple of non-leveraged returns.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-does-it-look-like-on-float-capital"></a>What does it look like on Float Capital?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-it-look-like-on-float-capital" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The absolute amount of volatility decay depends on certain factors:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="exposure-to-the-price-movements"></a>Exposure to the price movements<a class="hash-link" href="#exposure-to-the-price-movements" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The greater the exposure to leveraged movements, the greater the [absolute] volatility decay.
Our floating exposure mechanism means that the overbalanced side of a market will have a smaller degree of volatility decay experienced, as exposure will be less than 100%.</p><p>For the 2-OHM market, the exposure on the short side has been gradually decreasing, and therefore the size of absolute volatility decay has been decreasing as well – graph below.</p><img src="/blog-assets/volatility-decay-intro/exposure-2-ohm.png" alt="Exposure 2-OHM" width="100%"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="leverage-employed"></a>Leverage employed<a class="hash-link" href="#leverage-employed" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Currently our first 2 markets (Flipp3ning and 3TH) have 3x leverage, whereas our third market has 2x leverage on OHM. When it comes to leverage, there is a trade-off between capital efficiency and volatility decay.</p><p>For a user wanting to gain vanilla $1000 long exposure to OHM, it means that user has to only mint $500 on long 2-OHM (assuming exposure of 100%) to gain this exposure, allowing users to allocate their capital more efficiently.</p><p>However, the greater the leverage the greater the potential for volatility decay, and one way to find the correct balance is to observe the historical volatility decay in our markets and see whether they are at acceptable levels.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="absolute-difference-in-price-between-entry-and-exit"></a>Absolute difference in price between entry and exit<a class="hash-link" href="#absolute-difference-in-price-between-entry-and-exit" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The greater the difference in underlying price of the asset ‒ from the time a user enters the market to the time that they exit ‒ the greater the [absolute] volatility decay. For example, if a user enters a market when the price of the underlying asset is $100 and then exits when the price is $200, they would experience greater volatility decay than if they exited when the price was $150. The same goes for negative price movements. Note that the volatility decay is not necessarily 0 if the user exited at the same price that they entered.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="magnitude-of-underlying-price-movements"></a>Magnitude of underlying price movements<a class="hash-link" href="#magnitude-of-underlying-price-movements" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Float Capital updates user’s positions when the oracle price feed of the underlying asset gives a new price. The higher the change in the underlying price, the higher the volatility decay will be for any users with active positions at the time of price update. This effect is compounded when there are multiple price updates of high magnitude in the same direction, and is dampened when there are multiple price updates of high magnitude in opposite directions. For example, if there are 2 positive price movements (not necessarily consecutive) of high magnitude then the volatility decay is higher than if there was 1 positive and 1 negative of the same magnitude. </p><p>Note that the only time a user’s volatility decay is affected by large single price movements is if they hold a position in the market at the time of the price movement i.e. historical price movements do not affect new investments.</p><p>So how high is high? This is something that will be explored in detail in the next blog. But very basically: the relationship between the magnitude of a single price movement and the resulting volatility decay is linear (whose factor/gradient is dependent on the market leverage less 1), and is offset by the volatility decay before the price offset. For [a rough] example, if the current volatility decay for a user in a 2x leveraged market is 01% and the magnitude of the next price update is 10% then the resulting volatility decay is also 10% ; and in a 3x leveraged market it would be 20%). Note that this is a rough example and may not be entirely accurate.</p><p>The higher the inherent volatility of the asset, greater the potential volatility decay.</p><p>To reduce the volatility of the underlying asset as much as possible, Float uses a deviation threshold of 0.5% and a maximum heartbeat of 5 minutes (actually heartbeat for 3TH market is 27 seconds), asset by our oracle provider, Chainlink.</p><p>This means that the price feed will at least update every heartbeat, but also update sooner if the price changes by more than 0.5% from the previous price.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="volatility-decay-for-short-side-of-2-ohm-market"></a>Volatility Decay for short side of 2-OHM market<a class="hash-link" href="#volatility-decay-for-short-side-of-2-ohm-market" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><img src="/blog-assets/volatility-decay-intro/vol-decay-short-2-ohm.png" alt="Vol Decay Short 2-OHM" width="100%"><p>This graph shows the cumulative returns of 2-OHM (in blue) and OHM (in red) for the short side, as well as the volatility decay so far (in green) assuming that someone had entered the market from 2 Nov 2021 when market was created.</p><p>We see that volatility decay dropped to -2% in around 5 December 2021, which means that someone holding short 2-OHM would have outperformed someone holding twice the amount in vanilla OHM by 2%.</p><p>We have observed volatility decay from the short side above – what does this look like on the long side? A similar calculation can be done for volatility decay on the long side, which does not necessarily produce an equal and opposite value to the short volatility decay. </p><p>It is also important to note that because Float Capital is a peer-to-peer market, volatility decay is not lost forever, meaning volatility decay for one side is a gain for the other side on Float Capital, unlike in TradFi where the volatility decay cannot be captured and awarded to someone else.</p><p>For example, if the long side has experienced a 0.9% volatility decay over a 7-day period, then that 0.9% is retained by the short side.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="in-summary"></a>In Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#in-summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Volatility decay is something inevitable when it comes to leveraged assets, and the best is to put measures in place to limit its size.</p><p>In the article, we explored the mechanisms in place on Float Capital (such as floating exposure and our current practice with Chainlink) which reduce the size of volatility decay as much as possible for users.</p><p>One view that could be taken toward volatility decay is that it is the cost of using a capital efficient asset, which is achieved by employing leverage.</p><p>The amount of liquidity that did not shift as a result of volatility decay, will remain on the opposite side of the market (i.e. opposite side benefits from volatility decay on one side).</p><p>More technical deep dive coming soon for the wrinkle-brained Floatonians.</p><p>Happy leveraged trading!</p><p>If you want to learn more about Float Capital,<a href="https://docs.float.capital/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> check out our docs</a>,<a href="https://docs.float.capital/assets/files/FLOAT_CAPITAL_whitepaper-47161fff19d61864625c9dd681117f29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> read our whitepaper</a>, or<a href="https://discord.gg/yssvcFYbV9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> join our Discord</a>.</p><p>This piece was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/WooSung40265546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woo Sung Dong</a> and Stent (Anon).</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/shipping-a-funding-rate">We’re shipping a funding rate.

It has attracted so much capital that for a week during the last month we were the fastest growing derivatives protocol in all of DeFi.</p><p>However the success of the OHM market has raised a new challenge – the current mechanisms aren’t strong enough to incentivize better market balance between long and short positions with an asset that has a &gt;7000% rebase APY.</p><p>Because of this the majority of the OHM market positions are short. As a result the short positions are overbalanced and receive minimal short exposure since there is not enough long liquidity to take the other side of the trade. This makes Float a less efficient tool for hedging positions.</p><p>To correct this we will be introducing a funding rate mechanism to the protocol.</p><p>Float is still in the alpha stage and constantly refining the protocol to handle any type of market and any kind of asset. Our thesis remains, build, ship, iterate. The OHM market has been an incredible experiment and has shown us our path forward so that when the protocol moves out of alpha we will be able to create any kind of Magic Internet Asset.</p><p><strong>Funding rate</strong></p><p>When launching the protocol we initially thought that the leveraged yield incentive (all liquidity earning yield channelled to the underbalanced side) + asymmetric alphaFLT accrual would be enough to cater for this imbalance. However (alphaFLT aside), users going long OHM in Float only receive a 60% leveraged yield from aave for being long in contrast to getting &gt;7000% (rebase rewards) for it by staking their OHM on mainnet.</p><p><em>Our solution</em> - a funding rate! A funding rate is not a concept that we invented. Many perpetuals use funding rates to bring their assets to closely track their underlying. It was ambitious that we thought we could build a protocol that didn’t need this primitive, and not all markets need it. However, the OHM market, I’m sure you will agree, NEEDS a funding rate!</p><p><em>What is a funding rate?</em> A funding rate is payment made from the overbalanced side to the underbalanced side, to incentivize more balance in the market. More specifically for Float Capital there will be a constant trickle of liquidity from the overbalanced side to the underbalanced side of the market. As the markets become more imbalanced, the funding rate increases. For reference <a href="https://ftxpremiums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> are the funding rates for FTX.</p><p><strong>Float funding rate implementation</strong></p><p><em>How will this mechanism work?</em> We set a maximum funding rate for the overbalanced side that would only be achieved if the market were completely imbalanced (i.e. there was no liquidity on the underbalanced side). We then scale the funding rate linearly based on the imbalance. This simple formula can be seen <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/glkmxykdcx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. We have additional parameters that we can introduce later to adjust the shape of this curve, but we believe that the linear curve will be sufficient to create a massive impact while still remaining conservative. We are not expecting the funding rate alone to be enough to rebalance the market alone, rather it will be the second order effect of traders coming into the market to accept the high yields that rebalances the market.</p><p><em>What is a good initial funding rate setting for this market?</em> It is hard to know what kind of risk tolerance the market will have to going-in on the long side of OHM.</p><p>Given our current market imbalance, an additional APY of 2,000-3,500% could be sufficient. 3,500% with 2x leverage would be equivalent to the maximum longing OHM and staking can earn: ~7,000%. 2,000% is due to the increased capital efficiency of using Float Capital, the market fragmentation of being on a different blockchain and the easy access enabled by the low gas fees of polygon.</p><p>Being sensibly conservative, the initial proposal for implementation of this funding rate is a maximum of 300% for the OHM market, which at the current exposure of ~10% would mean the short side pays an annualized funding rate of 270%, or an hourly rate 0.03%.</p><p>This would give long OHM an APY of 2,400%.</p><p>If that has an underwhelming effect on the market we will take steps to increase it by a reasonable amount the next week, and again until it has the desired effect.</p><p>If the market rebalances to 50% exposure this would reduce to a funding rate of 150% on the short side and an APY boost on the long side of 300%</p><p>A funding rate of 270%, that we expect to reduce over time, is still comfortably below some of the larger funding rates that appear on FTX (which frequently go to 800% at times).</p><img src="/blog-assets/funding-rates/ftx-funding-rates.png" alt="FTX funding rates" width="100%"><p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/Float-Capital/contracts/commit/11a085fa9f5e433e3d57252cc845d393cd3906b0#r60963608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our code</a>, which is currently in for a 3rd party audit.

But selling isn’t very (3,3) of you.</p><p>The Float Capital OHM market opens up the possibility of a new strategy that doesn’t undermine the game theory inherent to the Olympus community: going delta neutral.</p><p>This means, in addition to your OHM stake, you can hold a short position on OHM to reduce your exposure to market volatility.</p><p>This will allow users to keep earning rewards for staking OHM, hedge against downward movements in the market, and earn FLT tokens from Float’s own staking incentives.</p><p>Currently FLT is in its alpha phase, so users will earn alphaFLT when staking in Float. When FLT launches around the end of 2021, alphaFLT will be taken off the market and current holders of the token will be rewarded.</p><header><h1 class="h1Heading_27L5">Calculating a delta neutral position</h1></header><p>A delta neutral strategy is equivalent to having zero exposure to the price of the underlying asset, in this case the OHM token. This means having 100% exposure to the price going up (long) and having 100% exposure to the price going down (short), simultaneously.</p><p>This allows APY returns without being exposed to the price movements of the OHM token. It’s a risk averse strategy for farming rewards.</p><p>Because the exposure in our markets ‘floats’ based on the balance of capital in each market, hedging your OHM position isn’t as simple as putting in 100% of your OHM position to get 100% hedging.</p><p>To understand this, head over to the market and check the exposure.</p><img src="/blog-assets/ohm/ohm-exposure.png" alt="Olympus DAO OHM exposure float capital" width="100%"><p>To explain exposure, we’ll use an example:</p><p>Let’s say Nachos has $1,000 of OHM tokens staked. This equates to 100% exposure to $1,000 of value. In order to get a delta neutral position he will need to get $1,000 value of short exposure.</p><p>Nachos would head over to Float Capital and check the exposure on the short side of the OHM market.</p><p>If that exposure is 100%, then in a 2x leveraged market, he will be able to fully hedge his position with only a $500 short position.</p><p>If the exposure is lower, say that it’s 50%, then since it’s a 2x leverage market, Nachos would go $1,000 short to get $1,000 short value exposure.</p><p>To make it easier to process, we’ve built a calculator for you in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17YUOcFmY1M9rAaJiYzMNzSugI0TGqKcd03RwUyWNAEc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google sheet</a>.

You’ll get the hedge you want with all the benefits of your OHM stake, and the added benefits from the Float protocol rewards system.</p><p>Just remember – in Float Capital, your leveraged exposure floats.

This has helped us unlock insights required for fine-tuning the parameters used in the protocol mechanisms.</p><p>A useful by-product of this is being able to share the results and insights with the community and future FLT token holders, who will eventually <strong>champion</strong> the governance of Float Capital DAO.</p><p>As one can reasonably expect, the results of the modelling process depend largely on the data as well as the assumptions made - let&#x27;s talk briefly about them before interpreting the results.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="data"></a><strong>Data</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#data" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We chose the Flipp3ning as the on-chain asset for modelling, the first market on Float Capital in the Alpha launch.
This is a 3x leveraged version of the Flippening, which is calculated as market capitalization of ETH over market capitalization of BTC.</p><p>The market movements of ETH and BTC can tend to be quite correlated at times as most outside speculation of crypto does not differentiate between coins, hence the reason for the 3x leverage to increase the volatility of the on-chain asset.</p><p>The modelling process runs over 30 days’ worth of data, recorded at an hourly interval; the actual heartbeat (frequency) of price feed in the Alpha and mainnet launch will actually be approximately 5 minutes, so we observed greater volatility in this data than we would observe on the protocol.</p><img src="/blog-assets/backtesting-flipp3ning/flipp3ning-historical.png" alt="flipp3ning-backetesting" width="100%"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="protocol-mechanisms"></a><strong>Protocol mechanisms</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#protocol-mechanisms" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Float Capital is a peer-to-peer magic internet asset marketplace where each market provides users with the option to take both long and short positions (for more information on Float Capital, click <a href="https://docs.float.capital/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Based on the total liquidity on each side (long and short), the one with the less liquidity (the undercapitalized side) will have 100% exposure to price movements and the one with more liquidity (the overcapitalized side) will have exposure equal to the ratio of the undercapitalized side to overcapitalized side (for example, if long has $100 and short has $90, short side will have 100% exposure and long side will have 90/100 = 90% exposure). This floating exposure mechanism ensures that the gains/losses due to price movements are always 100% collateralized in the protocol.</p><p>Then you might ask, for a given on-chain asset with a price trajectory, will one side not be greater than the other?</p><p>Yes, and hence enter the balancing incentives.</p><p>In Float Capital, users who mint positions in the undercapitalized side earn a portion of the yield that is generated by putting the total liquidity locked in the market into AAVE. Users with positions in the overcapitalized side do not receive any portion of the yield.
The balance of the yield is sent to the Treasury DAO and will provide price support for FLT tokens that are in circulation (for the Alpha launch, alphaFLT tokens will be issued instead of FLT tokens).
This incentivizes the users to balance the markets and hence bring the exposure of the overcapitalized side closer to 100%. This additional yield is calculated using a curve (click <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXsW4cHtxpJ5BFwRcMSUw7s5G11Qkte13NTEfPLTKEx4x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for formula and <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pnl43tfv5b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for graph).
There are further incentives in the form of higher FLT token issuance to users who stake on-chain tokens of the undercapitalized side, but we will cover the fine details of FLT token in another article.
In short, the FLT token is a rewards token to incentivise liquidity provision with mechanisms for profit share and price support while also acting as a governance token for the protocol.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="other-assumptions"></a><strong>Other assumptions</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#other-assumptions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Given the protocol mechanisms above and the price feeds, we project 2 types of liquidity injections into the system.
One is for the initial liquidity that float capital will inject into the system to ensure that the exposure for the users stays as close to 100% for the immediate future (until whales come to play) and the other for the subsequent liquidity that users will inject based on the market movements.</p><p>The user liquidity has been further divided into 2 types - <em>performance-based</em> and <em>incentive-based</em>.
<em>Performance-based</em> users will assess the recent performance of the on-chain asset in determining whether to enter long or short positions, whereas <em>incentive-based</em> users will assess the excess yield to determine whether to enter long or short positions.
The total user liquidity amount is set by multiplying the assumptions for average liquidity per user and the number of users interacting with the protocol.</p><p>An initial liquidity of $50,000 was split 50:50 between long and short sides and a total user liquidity of $150 was assumed per time interval.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="results-and-insights"></a><strong>Results and insights</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#results-and-insights" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5050-split-between-performance-based-and-incentive-based-users"></a>50:50 split between <em>performance-based</em> and <em>incentive-based</em> users<a class="hash-link" href="#5050-split-between-performance-based-and-incentive-based-users" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><img src="/blog-assets/backtesting-flipp3ning/model-50-50.png" alt="flipp3ning-backetesting" width="100%"><p>The liquidity on either side remains relatively balanced until the half-way point, as no significant fluctuations of the historical data are observed and the incentive-based users are injecting liquidity to capture the additional incentive and thereby balance the two sides.</p><p>Given the large upswing of the Flipp3ning around the half-way point, we observe that the long liquidity starts becoming significantly overcapitalized due to a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li>Increase in price of the Flipp3ning transfers liquidity from short to long side.</li><li>Upward trend of the Flipp3ning triggers <em>performance-based</em> users to mint long, who are hoping to capture future gains.</li></ol><p>At this point, exposure for the long liquidity starts decreasing significantly and the yield share for the undercapitalized (short) side starts increasing from 0, to incentivize users to mint positions in the short side.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2080-split-between-performance-based-and-incentive-based-users"></a>20:80 split between <em>performance-based</em> and <em>incentive-based</em> users<a class="hash-link" href="#2080-split-between-performance-based-and-incentive-based-users" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><img src="/blog-assets/backtesting-flipp3ning/model-20-80.png" alt="flipp3ning-backetesting" width="100%"><p>Here we observe a greater tendency towards a balanced market, as a larger portion of users are assumed to inject liquidity to capture the balancing incentives in the protocol.</p><p>The benefit of the markets being balanced come in a direct and indirect forms - exposure of the undercapitalized side remains as close to 100% as possible and majority of the yield share is accrued to the Treasury DAO which will provide a price support to FLT tokens issued to users.</p><p>The actual percentage of users who inject liquidity into the undercapitalized side will be determined by the relative gain of the balancing incentives to the possibility of impermanent loss in reality.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8020-split-between-performance-based-and-incentive-based-users"></a>80:20 split between <em>performance-based</em> and <em>incentive-based</em> users<a class="hash-link" href="#8020-split-between-performance-based-and-incentive-based-users" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><img src="/blog-assets/backtesting-flipp3ning/model-80-20.png" alt="flipp3ning-backetesting" width="100%"><p>A higher percentage of <em>performance-based</em> users will lead to greater divergence from an equilibrium between long and short sides, and this will amplify the balancing incentives for incentive-based users.</p><p>An interesting observation is that the exposure curve for 20:80 split and 80:20 split scenarios take on a similar shape around the half-way point when the Flipp3ning experiences a large gain over a short period.
If total liquidity in the market is considerably larger than the assumed user liquidity injections, any up/down swings of price will drown out user liquidity injections.</p><p>One thing to note is that the modelling process does not consider the higher FLT token issuance for the users who stake on the undercapitalized side yet, which may in practice result in higher rate of reversion towards an equilibrium between short and long liquidity.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="observation-of-the-alpha-experience"></a><strong>Observation of the Alpha experience</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#observation-of-the-alpha-experience" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>A <strong>massive</strong> positive is that we can compare the expected experience from the modelling to the Alpha experience!</p><img src="/blog-assets/backtesting-flipp3ning/massive.png" alt="flipp3ning-backetesting" width="50%"><p>Straight off the bat, the major difference to the model was that the <strong>initial liquidity</strong> from Float Capital was $20,000, with $10,000 in long and short at the launch.</p><p>But more importanly, only after 6 days since launch, we are sitting with TVL of $160,000+ in the protocol (one of few instances where I&#x27;m happy to be wrong about my assumptions).</p><p>And the balance between long and short?

This is in a similar vein to how we can release the Float Alpha without locking into a final smart contract design and hence allowing us to avoid large amounts of legacy so we can react quicker in future.</p><p>What will alphaFLT give you? At a very minimum, alphaFLT will entitle you to a proportional share of the Float Alpha treasury that will be accruing value throughout the Alpha. There are other possibilities which are still being modeled by the team. alphaFLT will initially be non-transferable while liquidity grows.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="alphaflt-issuance"></a><strong>alphaFLT issuance</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#alphaflt-issuance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>alphaFLT will be issued throughout the Float Capital Alpha phase. Currently 75% of all alphaFLT issued is going to users who stake magic internet assets and provide liquidity. 25% of alphaFLT issuance is accruing to a separate smart contract earmarked for the team, investors, advisors and founders, along with a few other strategic uses.</p><p>Importantly, alphaFLT is only ever issued based on the dollar value of your magic internet asset that you have staked, and the length of time which you have staked. Therefore, these tokens are only gradually generated over time as valuable actions occur in the platform.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="fees"></a><strong>Fees</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#fees" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There are no fees associated with minting, staking or redeeming magic internet assets. The only fees being levied in the Alpha are on unstaking your magic internet assets. This is currently set at 50 basis points or 0.5%. These fees accrue to the DAO treasury contract governed by Float Capital users.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="where-to-find-out-more"></a><strong>Where to find out more</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#where-to-find-out-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As much as we&#x27;ve gone through already, this is only the tip of the iceberg. There are so many interesting things happening under the hood, it&#x27;s an oasis for economists, computer scientists, mathematicians, financial engineers and statistical scientists.</p><p>The best way to understand the nuts and bolts is to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/dqDwgrVYcU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord</a> server and simply send a message.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="disclosures"></a><strong>DISCLOSURES</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#disclosures" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="only-deposit-money-you-can-afford-to-lose"></a><strong>Only deposit money you can afford to lose</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#only-deposit-money-you-can-afford-to-lose" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>This is a highly innovative and complex protocol that does not exist on any other chains or in any other galaxies. There is an <a href="https://docs.float.capital/blog/apeing-in-responsibly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">element of risk</a> involved, and it&#x27;s important you do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="team-holdings-and-positions-in-the-alpha"></a><strong>Team holdings and positions in the Alpha</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#team-holdings-and-positions-in-the-alpha" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>It&#x27;s important we are transparent. Given we will initially be playing a large role in deciding what becomes of alphaFLT tokens and how it connects with FLT tokens in the future, we want to remain impartial and choose only what is best for the protocol and not for personal gains.</p><p>Given this insight, it&#x27;s important we disclose the following internal trading restrictions: Float team members in their personal capacity should not be staking more than $2,000 of their personal capital initially. This target might change and we reserve the right to increase it. Any alphaFLT that is earned on staked positions over $2,000 will be redistributed in some form to benefit the protocol at large.</p><p>Additionally we are also running a team trading competition where every team member has been given $100 to trade. You will notice the protocol was actually deployed and went live on Monday. To ensure a smooth launch and have rigorous testing, we have been using these $100 amounts to test the protocol. Note that we have limited test staking to $1 of capital, over short periods, to ensure no one is earning alphaFLT unfairly ahead of the release.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learn-more"></a><strong>Learn more</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#learn-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you want to learn even more about Float, you can visit the <a href="https://docs.float.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs section</a> of our website.</p><p>If you want breaking news, memes and announcements, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/float_capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.</p><p>If you want to join the community, meet the team and get involved in the future of Float, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/StYzV8MP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries »</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/">Introduction</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/resources/">Resources</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/dqDwgrVYcU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/float_capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/float-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 Float Capital</div></div></div></footer></div>
