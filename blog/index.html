If you’re new to Avalanche, swap some AVAX for it on <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trader Joe</a>.</p><p>Then, head over to the <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/stake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staking dashboard</a>, and check out that sweet, sweet APR.</p><img src="/blog-assets/joe/staking-apr-joe.png" alt="float joe" width="100%"><p>Connect your wallet and select the amount of JOE to stake. Click stake. You’ll need to approve the app, then confirm the transaction.</p><p>By staking JOE you’ll swap your tokens for XJOE. The ratio of XJOE to JOE is constantly appreciating, so later you’ll be able to swap your XJOE into more JOE than you originally staked.</p><p>For an added layer of degeneracy, you can take your XJOE and lend it out in <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/#/lending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banker Joe</a>.</p><p>Now comes the delta neutral part.

Make sure you have some DAI to mint a position.</p><p>There are two variables to take into account when calculating your position.</p><p>The first is the market’s leverage: in this case 2x.</p><p>The second is the market’s exposure level. This is shown on the market stats at the bottom of the page, on the lower right hand side.</p><p>If the short side has 100% exposure, then, because of the 2x leverage, your short will be half the dollar value of your staked JOE. If it’s less than 100%, then we need to do some math.</p><p>Remember, the exposure can change based on the balance of capital in the market, so you will need to check this and rebalance periodically.</p><p>To calculate your short you’ll need a few variables:</p><p>Your JOE stake = joeStake
The short exposure = shortExposure
The size of your short position = short</p><p>Putting that together we get:</p><p>short = joeStake / (2 * shortExposure)</p><p>Or, you can just make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fk7McdHZZNYz4xTJrWajANTUlfzhJoXXGB_AcVIFK20/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheet</a> and punch in your figures.</p><p>Remember to check the exposure level regularly, to make sure that your stake is adequately covered.
